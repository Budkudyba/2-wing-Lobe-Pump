# 2-wing-Lobe-Pump
An experament to computationally simulate spirograph output towards a pump's lobe design

The lobe design was constructed in a jupyter notbook
The design was then edited in inkscape to remove unused curves
The output was an svg which was used to extrude and animate in fusion 360

TODO:
The goal is to eventually make a fuctional 3d printed oil pump.
